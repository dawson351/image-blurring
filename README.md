# image-blurring

This small project uses html, css, and javascript to apply blurring and load counter to an image source. Basic skills such as outlining the html, sourcing an image from a url, and formatting the image are coupled with a function to map the load counter and blurring effect to work simultaniously. Mapping function pulled from stackoverflow. This project was pulled from the Udemy 50 projects in 50 days lessons.
